# Analog_Clock_Alarm
This repository showcases a personal project where I have designed and implemented an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock not only provides a visually appealing representation of time but also includes an innovative alarm feature that can be customized to suit individual needs.

Key Features:

Analog Clock: The clock accurately displays the current time, complete with hour, minute, and second hands, providing a classic analog representation.

Alarm Functionality: Users can easily set their desired alarm time using intuitive controls. When the set alarm time is reached, the clock triggers a gentle alarm sound to alert the user.

Snooze Option: In addition to the alarm functionality, the clock incorporates a convenient snooze feature. When the alarm sounds, users can choose to snooze it for an additional 5 minutes, allowing for a gentle transition from sleep to wakefulness.

User-Friendly Interface: The project prioritizes a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the clock, set alarms, and manage the snooze functionality.

This personal project has been an exciting opportunity for me to explore front-end development techniques, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By combining these technologies, I have created a functional and visually appealing analog clock with additional alarm and snooze features, enhancing its practicality and usability.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the clock according to your preferences. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to further improve the functionality and user experience of this project.
